# KeyBindingInspector

Displays a searchable list of all bound keyboard shortcuts, along with the name of the command the shortcut will execute and any context rules that may restrict when the shortcut is available.

## Usage

To display the list of keyboard shortcuts, run the **Show All Key Bindings** command from the Command Palette, or hit **Ctrl+Alt+I** on Windows and Linux or **Command+Alt+I** on OS X.

## Notes

This is my first Sublime Text plugin, and I'm documenting the process of writing it in my Sublime Text ebook, [Sublime Productivity](http://sublimeproductivity.com).

I'm a Python and Sublime plugin newb, so I've borrowed the code that does the heavy lifting from the [FindKeyConflicts](https://github.com/skuroda/FindKeyConflicts). Thanks for the great work!
